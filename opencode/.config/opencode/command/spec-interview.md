description: Interview me in detail about a spec idea, then write the spec
---

Read the spec file @SPEC.md to understand the current state and context.

I have an idea I want to explore: $ARGUMENTS

Your task is to interview me in exhaustive detail about this idea. Ask me questions one at a time about:

- Technical implementation details (architecture, data models, APIs, state management)
- Edge cases and error handling
- UI & UX considerations (user flows, accessibility, responsiveness, loading states)
- Security implications and concerns
- Performance tradeoffs and optimizations
- Scalability considerations
- Integration points with existing systems
- Testing strategies
- Migration paths and backwards compatibility
- Deployment considerations
- Monitoring and observability

Important guidelines:
- Do NOT ask obvious questions that could be inferred from context or standard practices
- Ask probing, thoughtful questions that reveal hidden complexity
- Challenge assumptions and explore alternatives
- Ask follow-up questions based on my answers to dig deeper
- Cover both the "happy path" and failure modes
- Consider the perspective of different stakeholders (users, developers, ops)
- Ask ONE question at a time and wait for my response before continuing

Continue interviewing me iteratively until we have thoroughly explored all aspects of the idea. After each answer I give, determine if there are more areas to explore or clarify.

Once the interview is complete and we have a comprehensive understanding, write the full specification to the SPEC.md file, incorporating all the details we discussed.
