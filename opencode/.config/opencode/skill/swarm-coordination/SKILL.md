# Swarm Coordination

Multi-agent orchestration for parallel task execution. The coordinator breaks work into subtasks, spawns worker agents, monitors progress, and aggregates results.

## MANDATORY: Swarm Mail

**ALL coordination MUST use `swarmmail_*` tools.** This is non-negotiable.

Swarm Mail is embedded (no external server needed) and provides:

- File reservations to prevent conflicts
- Message passing between agents
- Thread-based coordination tied to cells

## When to Swarm

**DO swarm when:**

- Task touches 3+ files
- Natural parallel boundaries exist (frontend/backend/tests)
- Different specializations needed
- Time-to-completion matters

**DON'T swarm when:**

- Task is 1-2 files
- Heavy sequential dependencies
- Coordination overhead > benefit
- Tight feedback loop needed

**Heuristic:** If you can describe the task in one sentence without "and", don't swarm.

## Worker Survival Checklist (MANDATORY)

Every swarm worker MUST follow these 9 steps. No exceptions.

```typescript
// 1. INITIALIZE - Register with Swarm Mail
swarmmail_init({
  project_path: "/abs/path/to/project",
  task_description: "bead-id: Task description"
});

// 2. QUERY LEARNINGS - Check what past agents learned
semantic_memory_find({
  query: "task keywords domain",
  limit: 5
});

// 3. LOAD SKILLS - Get domain expertise
skills_list();
skills_use({ name: "relevant-skill" });

// 4. RESERVE FILES - Claim exclusive ownership
swarmmail_reserve({
  paths: ["src/assigned/**"],
  reason: "bead-id: What I'm working on",
  ttl_seconds: 3600
});

// 5. DO WORK
// ... implement changes ...

// 6. REPORT PROGRESS - Every 30min or at milestones
swarm_progress({
  project_key: "/abs/path/to/project",
  agent_name: "WorkerName",
  bead_id: "bd-123.4",
  status: "in_progress",
  message: "Auth service 80% complete, testing remaining",
  progress_percent: 80
});

// 7. CHECKPOINT - Before risky operations
swarm_checkpoint({
  bead_id: "bd-123.4",
  checkpoint_name: "pre-refactor",
  reason: "About to refactor auth flow"
});

// 8. STORE LEARNINGS - Capture what you discovered
semantic_memory_store({
  information: "OAuth refresh tokens need 5min buffer...",
  metadata: "auth, oauth, tokens"
});

// 9. COMPLETE - Auto-releases, runs UBS, records outcome
swarm_complete({
  project_key: "/abs/path/to/project",
  agent_name: "WorkerName",
  bead_id: "bd-123.4",
  summary: "Auth service implemented with JWT",
  files_touched: ["src/auth/service.ts", "src/auth/schema.ts"]
});
```

**Why These Steps Matter:**

| Step | Purpose | Consequence of Skipping |
|------|---------|-------------------------|
| 1. Init | Register identity, enable coordination | Can't send messages, reservations fail |
| 2. Query | Learn from past mistakes | Repeat solved problems, waste time |
| 3. Skills | Load domain expertise | Miss known patterns, lower quality |
| 4. Reserve | Prevent edit conflicts | Merge conflicts, lost work |
| 5. Work | Actually do the task | N/A |
| 6. Progress | Keep coordinator informed | Coordinator assumes stuck, may reassign |
| 7. Checkpoint | Safe rollback point | Can't recover from failures |
| 8. Store | Help future agents | Same bugs recur, no learning |
| 9. Complete | Clean release, learning signal | Reservations leak, no outcome tracking |

**If your subtask prompt doesn't include these steps, something is wrong with the coordinator.**

## Task Clarity Check (BEFORE Decomposing)

**Before decomposing, ask: Is this task clear enough to parallelize?**

### Vague Task Signals (ASK QUESTIONS FIRST)

| Signal                   | Example                        | Problem                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| No files mentioned       | "improve performance"          | Where? Which files?              |
| Vague verbs              | "fix", "update", "make better" | What specifically?               |
| Large undefined scope    | "refactor the codebase"        | Which parts? What pattern?       |
| Missing success criteria | "add auth"                     | OAuth? JWT? Session? What flows? |
| Ambiguous boundaries     | "handle errors"                | Which errors? Where? How?        |

### How to Clarify

```markdown
The task "<task>" needs clarification before I can decompose it.

**Question:** [Specific question about scope/files/approach]

Options:
a) [Option A] - [trade-off]
b) [Option B] - [trade-off]
c) [Option C] - [trade-off]

I'd recommend (a) because [reason]. Which approach?
```

**Rules:**

- ONE question at a time (don't overwhelm)
- Offer 2-3 concrete options when possible
- Lead with your recommendation and why
- Wait for answer before asking next question

### Clear Task Signals (PROCEED to decompose)

| Signal             | Example                        | Why it's clear   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Specific files     | "update src/auth/\*.ts"        | Scope defined    |
| Concrete verbs     | "migrate from X to Y"          | Action defined   |
| Defined scope      | "the payment module"           | Boundaries clear |
| Measurable outcome | "tests pass", "no type errors" | Success criteria |

**When in doubt, ask.** A 30-second clarification beats a 30-minute wrong decomposition.

## Coordinator Workflow

### Phase 0: Socratic Planning (NEW - INTERACTIVE)

**Before decomposing, engage with the user to clarify the task.**

Swarm supports three interaction modes:

| Mode | Flag | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **Full Socratic** | (default) | Ask questions, offer recommendations, collaborative planning |
| **Fast** | `--fast` | Skip questions, proceed with reasonable defaults |
| **Auto** | `--auto` | Minimal interaction, use heuristics for all decisions |
| **Confirm Only** | `--confirm-only` | Show plan, get yes/no, no discussion |

**Default Flow (Full Socratic):**

```typescript
// 1. Analyze task for clarity
const signals = analyzeTaskClarity(task);

if (signals.needsClarification) {
  // 2. Ask ONE question at a time
  const question = generateClarifyingQuestion(signals);
  
  // 3. Offer 2-3 concrete options
  const options = generateOptions(signals);
  
  // 4. Lead with recommendation
  const recommendation = selectRecommendation(options);
  
  // 5. Present to user
  console.log(`
The task "${task}" needs clarification before I can decompose it.

**Question:** ${question}

Options:
a) ${options[0].description} - ${options[0].tradeoff}
b) ${options[1].description} - ${options[1].tradeoff}
c) ${options[2].description} - ${options[2].tradeoff}

I'd recommend (${recommendation.letter}) because ${recommendation.reason}. Which approach?
  `);
  
  // 6. Wait for answer, iterate if needed
  const answer = await getUserResponse();
  
  // 7. Ask next question if needed (ONE at a time)
  if (needsMoreClarification(answer)) {
    // Repeat with next question
  }
}

// 8. Proceed to decomposition once clear
```

**Fast Mode (`--fast`):**

- Skip all questions
- Use reasonable defaults based on task type
- Proceed directly to decomposition

**Auto Mode (`--auto`):**

- Zero interaction
- Heuristic-based decisions for all choices
- Use for batch processing or CI

**Confirm Only (`--confirm-only`):**

- Generate plan silently
- Show final CellTree
- Get yes/no only

**Rules for Socratic Mode:**

- **ONE question at a time** - don't overwhelm
- **Offer concrete options** - not open-ended
- **Lead with recommendation** - save user cognitive load
- **Wait for answer** - don't proceed with assumptions

### Phase 1: Initialize Swarm Mail (FIRST)

```typescript
// ALWAYS initialize first - registers you as coordinator
await swarmmail_init({
  project_path: "$PWD",
  task_description: "Swarm: <task summary>",
});
```

### Phase 2: Knowledge Gathering (MANDATORY)

Before decomposing, query ALL knowledge sources:

```typescript
// 1. Past learnings from this project
semantic_memory_find({ query: "<task keywords>", limit: 5 });

// 2. How similar tasks were solved before
cass_search({ query: "<task description>", limit: 5 });

// 3. Design patterns and prior art
pdf_brain_search({ query: "<domain concepts>", limit: 5 });

// 4. Available skills to inject into workers
skills_list();
```

Synthesize findings into `shared_context` for workers.

### Phase 3: Decomposition (DELEGATE TO SUBAGENT)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Context Preservation Pattern**
>
> **NEVER do planning inline in the coordinator thread.** Decomposition work (file reading, CASS searching, reasoning about task breakdown) consumes massive amounts of context and will exhaust your token budget on long swarms.
>
> **ALWAYS delegate planning to a `swarm/planner` subagent** and receive only the structured CellTree JSON result back.

**❌ Anti-Pattern (Context-Heavy):**

```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS - pollutes main thread context
const plan = await swarm_plan_prompt({ task, ... });
// ... agent reasons about decomposition inline ...
// ... context fills with file contents, analysis ...
const validation = await swarm_validate_decomposition({ ... });
```

**✅ Correct Pattern (Context-Lean):**

```typescript
// 1. Create planning bead with full context
await hive_create({
  title: `Plan: ${taskTitle}`,
  type: "task",
  description: `Decompose into subtasks. Context: ${synthesizedContext}`,
});

// 2. Delegate to swarm/planner subagent
const planningResult = await Task({
  subagent_type: "swarm/planner",
  description: `Decompose task: ${taskTitle}`,
  prompt: `
You are a swarm planner. Generate a CellTree for this task.

## Task
${taskDescription}

## Synthesized Context
${synthesizedContext}

## Instructions
1. Use swarm_plan_prompt(task="...", max_subtasks=5, query_cass=true)
2. Reason about decomposition strategy
3. Generate CellTree JSON
4. Validate with swarm_validate_decomposition
5. Return ONLY the validated CellTree JSON (no analysis, no file contents)

Output format: Valid CellTree JSON only.
  `,
});

// 3. Parse result (subagent already validated)
const beadTree = JSON.parse(planningResult);

// 4. Create epic + subtasks atomically
await hive_create_epic({
  epic_title: beadTree.epic.title,
  epic_description: beadTree.epic.description,
  subtasks: beadTree.subtasks,
});
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Main thread context stays clean** - only receives final JSON, not reasoning
- **Subagent context is disposable** - gets garbage collected after planning
- **Scales to long swarms** - coordinator can manage 10+ workers without exhaustion
- **Faster coordination** - less context = faster responses when monitoring workers

### Phase 4: File Ownership (CRITICAL RULE)

**⚠️ COORDINATORS NEVER RESERVE FILES**

This is a hard rule. Here's why:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Coordinator reserving files
swarmmail_reserve({
  paths: ["src/auth/**"],
  reason: "bd-123: Auth service implementation"
});
// Then spawns worker... who owns the files?

// ✅ CORRECT - Worker reserves their own files
// Coordinator includes file list in worker prompt
const prompt = swarm_spawn_subtask({
  bead_id: "bd-123.4",
  files: ["src/auth/**"],  // Files listed here
  // ...
});

// Worker receives prompt with file list
// Worker calls swarmmail_reserve themselves
```

**Why This Pattern:**

| Coordinator Reserves | Worker Reserves |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Ownership confusion | Clear ownership |
| Who releases? | Worker releases via `swarm_complete` |
| Coordinator must track | Worker manages lifecycle |
| Deadlock risk | Clean handoff |

**Coordinator Responsibilities:**

1. **Plan** which files each worker needs (no overlap)
2. **Include** file list in worker prompt
3. **Mediate** conflicts if workers request different files
4. **Never** call `swarmmail_reserve` themselves

**Worker Responsibilities:**

1. **Read** assigned files from prompt
2. **Reserve** those files (step 4 of survival checklist)
3. **Work** exclusively on reserved files
4. **Release** via `swarm_complete` (automatic)

### Phase 5: Spawn Workers

```typescript
for (const subtask of subtasks) {
  const prompt = await swarm_spawn_subtask({
    bead_id: subtask.id,
    epic_id: epic.id,
    subtask_title: subtask.title,
    subtask_description: subtask.description,
    files: subtask.files,
    shared_context: synthesizedContext,
  });

  // Spawn via Task tool
  Task({
    subagent_type: "swarm/worker",
    prompt: prompt.worker_prompt,
  });
}
```

### Phase 6: MANDATORY Review Loop (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ AFTER EVERY Worker Returns, You MUST Complete This Checklist:**

This is the **quality gate** that prevents shipping broken code. DO NOT skip this.

```typescript
// ============================================================
// Step 1: Check Swarm Mail (Worker may have sent messages)
// ============================================================
const inbox = await swarmmail_inbox({ limit: 5 });
const message = await swarmmail_read_message({ message_id: N });

// ============================================================
// Step 2: Review the Work (Generate review prompt with diff)
// ============================================================
const reviewPrompt = await swarm_review({
  project_key: "/abs/path/to/project",
  epic_id: "epic-id",
  task_id: "subtask-id",
  files_touched: ["src/auth/service.ts", "src/auth/service.test.ts"]
});

// This generates a review prompt that includes:
// - Epic context (what we're trying to achieve)
// - Subtask requirements
// - Git diff of changes
// - Dependency status (what came before, what comes next)

// ============================================================
// Step 3: Evaluate Against Criteria
// ============================================================
// Ask yourself:
// - Does the work fulfill the subtask requirements?
// - Does it serve the overall epic goal?
// - Does it enable downstream tasks?
// - Type safety, no obvious bugs?

// ============================================================
// Step 4: Send Feedback (Approve or Request Changes)
// ============================================================
await swarm_review_feedback({
  project_key: "/abs/path/to/project",
  task_id: "subtask-id",
  worker_id: "WorkerName",
  status: "approved",  // or "needs_changes"
  summary: "LGTM - auth service looks solid",
  issues: "[]"  // or "[{file, line, issue, suggestion}]"
});

// ============================================================
// Step 5: ONLY THEN Continue
// ============================================================
// If approved:
//   - Close the cell
//   - Spawn next worker (if dependencies allow)
//   - Update swarm status
//
// If needs_changes:
//   - Worker gets feedback
//   - Worker retries (max 3 attempts)
//   - Review again when worker re-submits
//
// If 3 failures:
//   - Mark task blocked
//   - Escalate to human (architectural problem, not "try harder")
```

**❌ Anti-Pattern (Skipping Review):**

```typescript
// Worker completes
swarm_complete({ ... });

// Coordinator immediately spawns next worker
// ⚠️ WRONG - No quality gate!
Task({ subagent_type: "swarm/worker", prompt: nextWorkerPrompt });
```

**✅ Correct Pattern (Review Before Proceeding):**

```typescript
// Worker completes
swarm_complete({ ... });

// Coordinator REVIEWS first
swarm_review({ ... });
// ... evaluates changes ...
swarm_review_feedback({ status: "approved" });

// ONLY THEN spawn next worker
Task({ subagent_type: "swarm/worker", prompt: nextWorkerPrompt });
```

**Review Workflow (3-Strike Rule):**

1. Worker calls `swarm_complete` → Coordinator notified
2. Coordinator runs `swarm_review` → Gets diff + epic context
3. Coordinator evaluates against epic goals
4. If good: `swarm_review_feedback(status="approved")` → Task closed
5. If issues: `swarm_review_feedback(status="needs_changes", issues=[...])` → Worker fixes
6. After 3 rejections → Task marked blocked (architectural problem, not "try harder")

**Review Criteria:**
- Does work fulfill subtask requirements?
- Does it serve the overall epic goal?
- Does it enable downstream tasks?
- Type safety, no obvious bugs?

**Monitoring & Intervention:**

```typescript
// Check overall swarm status
const status = await swarm_status({ epic_id, project_key });
```

### Phase 7: Aggregate & Complete

- Verify all subtasks completed
- Run final verification (typecheck, tests)
- Close epic with summary
- Release any remaining reservations
- Record outcomes for learning

```typescript
await swarm_complete({
  project_key: "$PWD",
  agent_name: "coordinator",
  bead_id: epic_id,
  summary: "All subtasks complete",
  files_touched: [...],
});
await swarmmail_release(); // Release any remaining reservations
await hive_sync();
```

## Context Survival Patterns (CRITICAL)

Long-running swarms exhaust context windows. These patterns keep you alive.

### Pattern 1: Query Memory Before Starting

**Problem:** Repeating solved problems wastes tokens on rediscovery.

**Solution:** Query semantic memory FIRST.

```typescript
// At swarm start (coordinator)
const learnings = await semantic_memory_find({
  query: "auth oauth tokens",
  limit: 5
});

// Include in shared_context for workers
const shared_context = `
## Past Learnings
${learnings.map(l => `- ${l.information}`).join('\n')}
`;

// At worker start (survival checklist step 2)
const relevantLearnings = await semantic_memory_find({
  query: "task-specific keywords",
  limit: 3
});
```

**Why:** 5 learnings (~2k tokens) prevent rediscovering solutions (~20k tokens of trial-and-error).

### Pattern 2: Checkpoint Before Risky Operations

**Problem:** Failed experiments consume context without producing value.

**Solution:** Checkpoint before risky changes.

```typescript
// Before refactoring
await swarm_checkpoint({
  bead_id: "bd-123.4",
  checkpoint_name: "pre-refactor",
  reason: "About to change auth flow structure"
});

// Try risky change...

// If it fails, restore and try different approach
await swarm_restore_checkpoint({
  bead_id: "bd-123.4",
  checkpoint_name: "pre-refactor"
});
```

**When to Checkpoint:**

| Operation | Risk | Checkpoint? |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Add new file | Low | No |
| Refactor across files | High | Yes |
| Change API contract | High | Yes |
| Update dependencies | Medium | Yes |
| Fix typo | Low | No |
| Rewrite algorithm | High | Yes |

### Pattern 3: Store Learnings Immediately

**Problem:** Discoveries get lost in context churn.

**Solution:** Store learnings as soon as you discover them.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Wait until end
// ... debug for 30 minutes ...
// ... find root cause ...
// ... keep working ...
// ... forget to store learning ...

// ✅ CORRECT - Store immediately when discovered
// ... debug for 30 minutes ...
// ... find root cause ...
await semantic_memory_store({
  information: "OAuth refresh tokens need 5min buffer to avoid race conditions. Without buffer, token refresh can fail mid-request if expiry happens between check and use.",
  metadata: "auth, oauth, tokens, race-conditions"
});
// ... continue working with peace of mind ...
```

**Trigger:** Store a learning whenever you say "Aha!" or "That's why!".

### Pattern 4: Progress Reports Trigger Auto-Checkpoints

**Problem:** Workers forget to checkpoint manually.

**Solution:** `swarm_progress` auto-checkpoints at milestones.

```typescript
// Report progress at 25%, 50%, 75%
await swarm_progress({
  project_key: "/abs/path",
  agent_name: "WorkerName",
  bead_id: "bd-123.4",
  status: "in_progress",
  progress_percent: 50,  // Auto-checkpoint triggered
  message: "Auth service half complete"
});
```

**Auto-checkpoint thresholds:** 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% (completion).

### Pattern 5: Delegate Heavy Research to Subagents

**Problem:** Reading 10+ files or doing deep CASS searches pollutes main thread.

**Solution:** Subagent researches, returns summary only.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Coordinator reads files inline
const file1 = await read("src/a.ts");  // 500 lines
const file2 = await read("src/b.ts");  // 600 lines
const file3 = await read("src/c.ts");  // 400 lines
// ... context now +1500 lines ...

// ✅ CORRECT - Subagent reads, summarizes
const summary = await Task({
  subagent_type: "explore",
  prompt: "Read src/a.ts, src/b.ts, src/c.ts. Summarize the auth flow in 3 bullet points."
});
// ... context +3 bullets, subagent context disposed ...
```

**When to Delegate:**

- Reading >3 files
- Multiple CASS searches
- Deep file tree exploration
- Analyzing large logs

### Pattern 6: Use Summaries Over Raw Data

**Problem:** Full inboxes, file contents, search results exhaust tokens.

**Solution:** Summaries and previews only.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Fetch all message bodies
const inbox = await swarmmail_inbox({ include_bodies: true });

// ✅ CORRECT - Headers only, read specific messages
const inbox = await swarmmail_inbox({ limit: 5 });  // Headers only
if (inbox.urgent.length > 0) {
  const msg = await swarmmail_read_message({ message_id: inbox.urgent[0].id });
}

// ✅ BETTER - Summarize threads
const summary = await swarmmail_summarize_thread({ thread_id: "bd-123" });
```

**Token Budget:**

| Approach | Tokens |
|----------|--------|
| 10 full messages | ~5k |
| 10 message headers | ~500 |
| Thread summary | ~200 |

### Context Survival Checklist

- [ ] Query semantic memory at start
- [ ] Checkpoint before risky operations
- [ ] Store learnings immediately when discovered
- [ ] Use `swarm_progress` for auto-checkpoints
- [ ] Delegate heavy research to subagents
- [ ] Use summaries over raw data
- [ ] Monitor token usage (stay under 150k)

**If you're past 150k tokens, you've already lost. These patterns keep you alive.**

## Decomposition Strategies

Four strategies, auto-selected by task keywords:

| Strategy           | Best For                      | Keywords                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **file-based**     | Refactoring, migrations       | refactor, migrate, rename, update all |
| **feature-based**  | New features, vertical slices | add, implement, build, create         |
| **risk-based**     | Bug fixes, security           | fix, bug, security, critical          |
| **research-based** | Investigation, discovery      | research, investigate, explore        |

See `references/strategies.md` for full details.

## Communication Protocol

Workers communicate via Swarm Mail with epic ID as thread:

```typescript
// Progress update
swarmmail_send({
  to: ["coordinator"],
  subject: "Auth API complete",
  body: "Endpoints ready at /api/auth/*",
  thread_id: epic_id,
});

// Blocker
swarmmail_send({
  to: ["coordinator"],
  subject: "BLOCKED: Need DB schema",
  body: "Can't proceed without users table",
  thread_id: epic_id,
  importance: "urgent",
});
```

**Coordinator checks inbox regularly** - don't let workers spin.

## Intervention Patterns

| Signal                  | Action                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Worker blocked >5 min   | Check inbox, offer guidance          |
| File conflict           | Mediate, reassign files              |
| Worker asking questions | Answer directly                      |
| Scope creep             | Redirect, create new bead for extras |
| Repeated failures       | Take over or reassign                |

## Failure Recovery

### Incompatible Outputs

Two workers produce conflicting results.

**Fix:** Pick one approach, re-run other with constraint.

### Worker Drift

Worker implements something different than asked.

**Fix:** Revert, re-run with explicit instructions.

### Cascade Failure

One blocker affects multiple subtasks.

**Fix:** Unblock manually, reassign dependent work, accept partial completion.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                | Symptom                                    | Fix                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Decomposing Vague Tasks** | Wrong subtasks, wasted agent cycles        | Ask clarifying questions FIRST       |
| **Mega-Coordinator**        | Coordinator editing files                  | Coordinator only orchestrates        |
| **Silent Swarm**            | No communication, late conflicts           | Require updates, check inbox         |
| **Over-Decomposed**         | 10 subtasks for 20 lines                   | 2-5 subtasks max                     |
| **Under-Specified**         | "Implement backend"                        | Clear goal, files, criteria          |
| **Inline Planning** ⚠️      | Context pollution, exhaustion on long runs | Delegate planning to subagent        |
| **Heavy File Reading**      | Coordinator reading 10+ files              | Subagent reads, returns summary only |
| **Deep CASS Drilling**      | Multiple cass_search calls inline          | Subagent searches, summarizes        |
| **Manual Decomposition**    | Hand-crafting subtasks without validation  | Use swarm_plan_prompt + validation   |

## Full Swarm Flow

```typescript
// 1. Initialize Swarm Mail FIRST
swarmmail_init({ project_path: "$PWD", task_description: "..." });

// 2. Gather knowledge
semantic_memory_find({ query });
cass_search({ query });
pdf_brain_search({ query });
skills_list();

// 3. Decompose
swarm_plan_prompt({ task });
swarm_validate_decomposition();
hive_create_epic();

// 4. Reserve files
swarmmail_reserve({ paths, reason, ttl_seconds });

// 5. Spawn workers (loop)
swarm_spawn_subtask();

// 6. Monitor
swarm_status();
swarmmail_inbox();
swarmmail_read_message({ message_id });

// 7. Complete
swarm_complete();
swarmmail_release();
hive_sync();
```

## ASCII Art, Whimsy & Diagrams (MANDATORY)

**We fucking LOVE visual flair.** Every swarm session should include:

### Session Summaries

When completing a swarm, output a beautiful summary with:

- ASCII art banner (figlet-style or custom)
- Box-drawing characters for structure
- Architecture diagrams showing what was built
- Stats (files modified, subtasks completed, etc.)
- A memorable quote or cow saying "ship it"

### During Coordination

- Use tables for status updates
- Draw dependency trees with box characters
- Show progress with visual indicators

### Examples

**Session Complete Banner:**

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃         🐝 SWARM COMPLETE 🐝                 ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃   Epic: Add Authentication                   ┃
┃   Subtasks: 4/4 ✓                            ┃
┃   Files: 12 modified                         ┃
┃                                              ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

**Architecture Diagram:**

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   INPUT     │────▶│  PROCESS    │────▶│   OUTPUT    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

**Dependency Tree:**

```
epic-123
├── epic-123.1 ✓ Auth service
├── epic-123.2 ✓ Database schema
├── epic-123.3 ◐ API routes (in progress)
└── epic-123.4 ○ Tests (pending)
```

**Ship It:**

```
    \   ^__^
     \  (oo)\_______
        (__)\       )\/\
            ||----w |
            ||     ||

    moo. ship it.
```

**This is not optional.** PRs get shared on Twitter. Session summaries get screenshot. Make them memorable. Make them beautiful. Make them fun.

Box-drawing characters: `─ │ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼ ━ ┃ ┏ ┓ ┗ ┛`
Progress indicators: `✓ ✗ ◐ ○ ● ▶ ▷ ★ ☆ 🐝`
