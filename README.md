To get set up:

1. Install kitty.
2. Clone this repo to `$HOME`.
3. `brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit`.
4. `brew install gh`
5. `brew install raycast`.
6. Go into Raycast and use the Import thing on the `.raycast` file in `/.config`. (Extensions still don't work for whatever reason, you still have to install them.)

...at least I think. Haven't really tested it yet.
